    description: `Given two positive integers, determine whether the first one is larger than the second one.

Input Constraints:
- Input contains one line with two positive integers a and b, separated by a space
- The integers are in the range: 0 < a,b â‰¤ 1,000,000,000 (10^9)

Example 1:
Input: "1 19"
Output: "0"

Example 2:
Input: "4 4"
Output: "0"

Example 3:
Input: "23 14"
Output: "1"`,

    // Read the line containing two numbers
    
    // TODO: Parse the numbers and determine if the first is greater
